This is a custom integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) that provides sensor data from an ADA Meter, including total energy consumption, phase voltage, current, power factors, and more.

This is a modified version for easier handling, more devices can be managed with it, adapted to the new energy dashboard
